## Product Vision

In a world where technology evolves much faster than a decade ago, people feel the urge to evolve with it. As this happens, the amount of information available grows much faster than the ways to get it. People found that each gathering participants is a port of data.  Our purpose is to diminish the obstacles in this and help that happen. “If you have knowledge, let others light their candles in it.” -Margaret Fuller

Mingler is an application that aims to promote and facilitate the interaction between individuals attending a conference, mainly when these have common interests. Hence, we aim to create a whole new dimension to social interaction within conferences.

Mingler makes attending a conference alone more satisfying and networking a less awkward and formal experience.

Users create an account and choose their personal interests from those addressed at the conference. Mingler will generate matches during the length of the conference based on the user’s interests and proximity, therefore it will provide peer-to-peer interactions surpassing the usual problem of not being able to interact with large groups or in the midst of a large and busy environment.

## Elevator Pitch

Where does one promote the best companies and ideas? At conferences.

Why do people go to conferences instead of reading about them online? To meet people.

And what’s the main problem with conferences? Participants rarely interact with others with the same interests as theirs.
This is where Mingler comes to play. Mingler solves all these problems and guarantees you get exactly what you want out of the conference.


Scratch your tingle, get ready to mingle!
